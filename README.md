# Fortinet Platform Engineering - API and WEB containers
## Deploy Terraform with this app

This project has the goal to showcase how can be possible to implement a platform to provide developers a safe environment to deploy their apps. It is based on Terraform to deploy infrastructure in Cloud and API calls to configure SaaS services as GitHub or Fortinet FortiWEB Cloud WAAP.

## Introduction

You can find these folders:
* [0_deploy_fgt_hub](./0_deploy_fgt_hub/) (optional): an example of Terraform deployment of a Fortigate NGFW within AWS acting as a SDWAN HUB.
* [1_deploy_plf_eng_app](./1_deploy_plf_eng_app/): this folder contains the platform containers servers to deploy Terraform code.

## Requirements
* Docker container server
* Docker compose

## Deployment
* (Optional) Deploy Fortigate in AWS acting as a SDWAN HUB (follow this [repo](https://github.com/jmvigueras/modules/tree/main/aws/examples/fgt-ha-2az_onramp) for guidance)
* Go to [1_deploy_plf_eng_app](./1_deploy_plf_eng_app/)
* Update enviroments variables for container [docker-compose.yml.example](./1_deploy_plf_eng_app/docker-compose.yml.example)
```
      TF_VAR_access_key: '{{access_key}}'
      TF_VAR_secret_key: '{{secret_key}}'
      TF_VAR_aws_role_arn: '{{aws_role_arn}}'
      TF_VAR_fwb_cloud_token: '{{fwb_cloud_token}}'
      TF_VAR_github_token: '{{github_token}}'
      TF_VAR_fortidevsec_org: '{{fortidevsec_org}}'
      TF_VAR_fortidevsec_app: '{{fortidevsec_app}}' 
```
* Rename to docker-compose.yml
* Build local container images:
```
# docker build -t web-plf-eng:v1 ./web_plf_eng
# docker build -t api-plf-eng:v1 ./api_plf_eng   
```
* Create new network in docker: 
```
# docker network create net-plf-eng
```
* Deploy containers:
 ```
# docker-compose up -d
```

## How to
* After run container connect to http://localhost:8000
* Clone repository url: https://github.com/jmvigueras/plf-eng-demo-code.git

![Clone repo](./images/image1.png)

* Deploy Terraform code (The platform asks for an AWS external id to adquire the role to deploy).
* Add FortiFlex token to license the FGT (VM02).
* (Terraform variables) variables are also defined as environment variables when container image has been created in [docker-compose.yml](./1_deploy_plf_eng_app/docker-compose.yml.example)

* After successful deploy outputs will appears

**READ**

The deployed Terrafom code has created the following resources:

- AWS VPC and necessary subnets.
- Fortigate NGFW.
- Kubernetes self-managed cluster.
- AWS Route53 DNS records.
- FortiWEB Cloud new APPs.
- GitHub repository (secrests and workflow action).

It is mandatory to provide necessary API tokens to configure all those services.

* Destroy
